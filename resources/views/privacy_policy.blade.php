			<li class="pb-5px">
				Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to
				purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail and/or SMS to your mobile phone number confirming
				receipt of your order and/or containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail and/or
				SMS"). The Order Confirmation E-mail and/or SMS is acknowledgement that we have received your order, but
				does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered; that when we send the Order
				Confirmation E-mail and/or SMS a contract called an “agreement to sell” is concluded in accordance with
				Section 4(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 i.e. the transfer of the property in the goods is to take
				place at a future time when the product(s) is/are delivered to your designated address. We only accept
				your offer, and the above “agreement to sell” becomes a contract of sale for product(s) ordered by you
				in accordance with Section 4(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, when the product(s) is/are delivered to
				your designated address and at that time the property in the goods is transferred from us to you.
				</li><li class="pb-5px">
				You can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before the goods are delivered to you.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-5px">
				Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the typical needs of an
				</li>
				average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the
				placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical
				for a normal household.
			
		</ol>

		<h3 class="pb-10px pt-10px">7. Product Descriptions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li class="pb-5px">
				eCommerce attempts to be as accurate as possible. eCommerce does not manufacture or produce any
				product by themselves. Therefore, eCommerce does not warrant that product descriptions or other
				content of any eCommerce product is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product
				offered by eCommerce itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 class="pb-10px pt-10px">8. Pricing</h3>
		<ol>
			<li class="pb-5px">
				Except where noted otherwise, the list price or suggested price displayed for products on
				eCommerce represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer
				or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value
				for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The list price or suggested price is a comparative
				price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day.
			</li>
			<li class="pb-5px">
				Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the MRP of
				an item sold by eCommerce is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact
				you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. And if
				the stated price on the product is lower than eCommerce, we will, either refund the amount or replace
				the product according to your preference, when acknowledged.
